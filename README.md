# Project3
I made this as part of my digital arts & sciences class. We were practicing rendering things-- in specific, how to manually create complex shapes and how to render imported objects.

This project was made with Processing, a free graphical library and IDE that uses Java. Be sure to rename the root folder to Project3 if you'd like to run it for yourself.
